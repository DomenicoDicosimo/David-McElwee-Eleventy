**Well, geez as s group of thrill seekers, imagine the odds of each of you parachuting into this library with nary a twisted ankle or ruptured Achilles.

Hello, my name’s Dave McElwee I’m honored to have the opportunity to present…Inside My Afterlife to share a glimpse into the writing of my first novel at the S.W. Smith Library and thanks to Imani Klein for facilitating this fund raiser featuring a My Afterlife gift basket designed by my wife Debra.

The S.W. Smith Memorial Public Library has been serving area patrons since 1930. The library was named after businessman Samuel Walter Smith.  His wife Eleanor was credited as the driving force in the libraries founding. Fast fact did you know Port Allegany was once known as Canoe Place. Rumor has it, the name change occurred in 1838 after a geographically challenged nine-foot allegator was captured from the Allegany River near Dunbar crossing.  Fearing a public backlash if this news were made public, the leaders of the day concocted a story under the guise of protecting the community from unnecessary fear realizing gator sightings are rare in this part of the country. So, they proposed changing the town’s name to Port Allegany and incorporated the captured alligator as the campaigns mascot in promoting river commerce. Their slogan was, ‘Our waterways are so friendly, even an alligator felt invited’. The campaign was a big hit commercially leaving the public none the wiser.  Few today are aware this is the origin story for the nickname for those calling themselves Port Allegany Gators.  Truth is stranger than fiction.
But here’s the part of the story I find incredulous. Some speculate when the navigationally challenged mascot allegator died it was taxidermized and stuffed with gold bars then hidden somewhere in McKean County waiting to be discovered! You be the judge as to that claim.
As a Smethport native I’ve always thought of Port as a close cousin who lived just down the road. I guess in hindsight that to be the case since my father and his six siblings who were farmers on Dunbar crossing.  My mother always lived in Smethport.  Meaning one of your Gators defected and to become a Hubber! 
-All I know is this, we start at one point and end in another and do stuff in between. It’s good to be alive...thanks for being here!**
