This is an event that occurred in January 2023 to celebrate and discuss David McElwee's recently released novel 'My Afterlife.' It marks a day when family and friends came together to enjoy one another's company and congratulate David on a monumental personal achievement. 

The Pre-Release Party has already transpired, however time travelers are welcome to attend.
