      <p class="cs-text">
        My Afterlife unwraps the story of small-town friends as though watching them through a rotating kaleidoscope. Together they face emotional ups and downs but none more profound than the blunt force trauma of watching another's kaleidoscope cease to rotate.

        My Afterlife is a novel set in Smethport, Pennsylvania. It arrives just in time to celebrate the towns 170th birthday. Coincidently, the novel ends following the extraordinary fireworks capping Smethport's 150th birthday. My Afterlife is an inside view of a little- known story in which a truth was learned by the friends gathered at the cemetery while the towns citizens surrounded the lake enjoying the arial light show closing the sesquicentennial twenty years ago!
