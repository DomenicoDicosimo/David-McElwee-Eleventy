        Beware, don't judge a book by its cover! My Accidental Investigation is a magical realism novel influenced by the field of psychology. The emotionally tense story is tempered with humor to reduce the sting when realizing life is fraught with unseen dangers.What does a serial predator whose camouflage is that of a devout funeral home director, a traumatized postal worker with a penchant for writing notes, and a twelve-year-old girl with Down syndrome who draws her memories have in common?The answer is Dr. Stimps, a well-respected psychologist facing her mortality while embarking on a profound journey triggered by a seemingly innocent question: Do you want Life Savers from your guardian angel?"This question unexpectedly links her with characters from the writer's first novel, My Afterlife.The unconventional group collaborates to end the predator's twenty-six-year reign. Their journey is summarized best by Dr. Stimps: "Life is complex with many vagaries, eddies, side trails, offshoots, and hidden passages. We are always converging. Occasionally a common thread somehow weaves its way through a seemingly random group of people to create a shared convergence. What a great one it was!"
